# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Task
As a developer, I've been tasked with refactoring Horiseon's website's code 
so that it meets accesibility standards. I've made changes to the HTML and CSS files

### For the HTML file I've:
* implemented Semantic HTML elements
* included alt attributes to image elements
* corrected the structure of HTML elements so they follow a logical structure
* added a descriptive title
* made sure all links work properly

### For the CSS file I've:
* consolidated CSS selectors and properties
* organized CSS file to follow semantic structure
* properly commented the CSS file
