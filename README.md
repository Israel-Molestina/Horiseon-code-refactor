# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Task
    As a developer, I've been tasked with refactoring Horiseon's website's code 
    so that it meets accesibility standards. I've made changes to the HTML and CSS files

### For the HTML file I've:
    * implemented Semantic HTML elements
    * included alt attributes to image elements
    * corrected the structure of HTML elements so they follow a logical structure
    * added a descriptive title
        * test
    * made sure all links work properly

### For the CSS file I've:
    * consolidated CSS selectors and properties
    * organized CSS file to follow semantic structure
    * properly commented the CSS file
