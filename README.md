# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Task
    As a developer, I've been tasked with refactoring Horiseon's website's code 
    so that it meets accesibility standards.
    In order to do this, I've:
    *implemented Semantic HTML elements
    *included alt attributes to image elements
    *corrected the structure of HTML elements so they follow a logical structure
    *added a descriptive title
    *made sure all links work properly
    *consolidated CSS selectors and properties
    *organized CSS file to follow semantic structure
    *properly commented the CSS file
